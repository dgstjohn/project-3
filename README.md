## User Story

The idea behind this project was to make online sports betting easier and faster than ever! Instead of going to FanDuel, Draft Kings, or any other bookmaker, you would go to Odds and Ends! Currently, the app only allows for betting on the NFL, but in future updates we will allow betting on virtually any sport.

## Development

The front end of this application was built and styled by Richard Long, with additional styling and formatting provided by Don St. John, Jacob Millspaugh and Kevin White. The back end was built by Don St. John and Kevin White. The odds themselves were sourced from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/), which allowed us to find NFL games, and the betting odds for each game as listed by 18 different bookmakers.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to Heroku.
